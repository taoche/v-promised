# v-promised

inspired by vue-promised

I reimplemented and added states using the state machine approach

```
BYPASSED
PENDING
FULFILLED
REJECTED
EMPTY
```

I also conceived of a functional implementation, The purpose is not to render nodes in the vue-devtools, But it's not very usable.
I will try to perfect it
